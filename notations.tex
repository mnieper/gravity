\chapter*{Notations}

\paragraph{Standard sets}
We use the following notations for the standard sets: The set of natural
numbers (which includes $0$, by definition) is denoted by $\set N_0$, the set
of integers by $\set Z$, the set of rational numbers by $\set Q$, the set of
real numbers by $\set R$ and the set of complex numbers by $\set C$.

\paragraph{Maps}

By a \emph{differential map} we will always mean of map of class $\mathcal C^\infty$
that is a smooth map. \emph{Differentiability} thus means the existence of
continuous derivates to all orders.

The term \emph{function} will be reserved for smooth maps with values in $\set R$.
Thus a function is always a smooth function.

\paragraph{Cartesian space}
The standard Euclidean norm an $n$-dimensional space $\set R^n$ is denoted
by
\[
    \norm v \coloneqq \sqrt{\sum_{i = 1}^n v_i^2}
\]
for $v = (v_1, \dotsc, v_n) \in \set R^n$.
