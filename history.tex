\chapter*{History}

The theory of general relativity was being developed by Albert Einstein between
1907 and 1915. It builds upon and combines the earlier theories of Newtonian
gravity and special relativity. Although the basic theory hasn't changed since
then, there have been many contributions afterwards. The following timeline
summarizes the history as far it is relevant to the notes at hand.
